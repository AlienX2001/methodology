## usually you just find services worth exploiting and then exploit them do priv esc but for a reference and as a compilation of my past experiences here is the notes
- first enumerate and gather all info
- after gathering look at ur perms and see which files can you read/write or execute keep your main focus on log files and backup files
- look at all the proccess and see if you can leverage any of them
- u can use the inbuilt tools like ps (ps aux) or tools like pspy, etc. to have a look
